=-=- Required setup - please read -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  In normal operation, opam only alters files within ~/.opam.

  However, to best integrate with your system, some environment variables
  should be set. If you allow it to, this initialisation step will update
  your sh configuration by adding the following line to ~/.profile:

    test -r /home/opam/.opam/opam-init/init.sh && . /home/opam/.opam/opam-init/init.sh > /dev/null 2> /dev/null || true

  Otherwise, every time you want to access your opam installation, you will
  need to run:

    eval `opam config env`

  You can always re-run this setup with 'opam init' later.

Do you want opam to modify ~/.profile ? [N/y/f]
(default is 'no', use 'f' to choose a different file)
