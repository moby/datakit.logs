=-=- qtest.2.5 installed successfully -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
=> Version similar to 2.4, except it uses qcheck as an external library
     instead of embedding it. There should be no other difference.

     To use it, still call `qtest` on your .ml/.mli files to extract tests,
     then compile the resulting suite using oUnit and qcheck.

=-=- qcheck.0.5.2 installed successfully =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
=> new release that fixes some problems with 0.5.1,
   including a better handling of backtraces, safe-string awareness,
   a mode for long tests, and reverting `small_int` to being an alias to `nat`.

   The latter point is important for not breaking code that would use
   `small_int`
   to pick the size of lists, strings, etc. The new `small_signed_int` can
   be used instead.
